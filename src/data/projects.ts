  LimitPocket is a personal finance management app designed to help users take control of their spending, savings, and budgeting habits.
  
  ## 📱 Project Overview
  
  LimitPocket is a full-stack financial tracking application with a mobile-first approach. It allows users to seamlessly track expenses, set savings goals, monitor budgets, and gain insights into their financial health.
  
  ## 🧠 Key Features
  
  - Real-time expense tracking with category filters
  - Create and monitor savings goals
  - Budget planning and analysis
  - Financial summary reports
  - Secure login and data handling
  - Offline data access with persistent local storage
  
  ## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
  
  The mobile application was built using **Kotlin** for Android. Initially, I implemented local data storage using **SharedPreferences** for simplicity. As the app matured, I migrated to **SQLite** for structured data storage and later integrated **Room ORM** for efficient database access and better data abstraction.
  
  The app also features a **React.js** web interface connected to a shared **Node.js** backend, enabling cross-platform data synchronization for an enhanced user experience.`,
